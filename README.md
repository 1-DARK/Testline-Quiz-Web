# Testline Project

## Overview

Testline is a demonstration project designed to explore modern web development techniques and integration. This repository includes a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code along with Tailwind CSS for styling. It serves as a testing ground for creating responsive layouts, dynamic content rendering, and integrating various frontend and backend technologies.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS to build responsive and modern interfaces.
- **Multiple Demo Pages:** Includes several HTML pages (e.g., Doc1.html, Doc2.html, Doc3.html, Doc4.html, Pay.html, Quiz.html) to showcase different design elements and functionalities.
- **Dynamic Interactions:** JavaScript and JSON data (data.json) are used to add dynamic and interactive elements to the web pages.
- **Backend Integration:** Contains a Python script (ABC.py) to demonstrate backend or scripting capabilities.
- **Extensible Structure:** A clear folder structure and configuration (tailwind.config.js, package.json) support further development and feature additions.
